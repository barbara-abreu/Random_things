# Assorted_thingies
Just small scripts I sometimes do, along with some scripts I make at my work.

### Random phone number generators.
 	phone_number_generator_file.cpp 
	phone_number_generator_file.py

Scripts to generate random mobile phone numbers (from Portugal).
I got this idea when some marketing company called me and told my phone number had been randomly generated.

Did the same script in both python and C++, just to test running speed (and for fun obv). The C++ version is ~10 times faster.

### Processing text output files
